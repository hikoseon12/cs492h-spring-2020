## Important Notes about Registering for this Course

- If you are lucky enough to be registered and selected for this class, PLEASE make sure you will not drop this class after it starts. If you are thinking of just "shopping around" to see what this course is like, please DROP IT NOW, so that students who really want to take this course can register. So please give up your seat if you are not serious about this course.
- If you have emailed me about not being able to register for this class because you have taken another CS492 before, you will be entered into a lottery and randomly picked (about 5 students) to be added into this class. If you are selected, you must come to the first class to get your form signed.
- If you registered for this class but did not get selected, I cannot add you. There are too many students asking to be added. Hopefully some students will be dropping, so you can check frequently to see if there is an available slot.

## Prerequisites  

- You need to have good programming skills in Python.
- You need to have understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts (CS376, CS470, or any other undergraduate ML/DL courses).
